Student Course Information Website in HTML, CSS, and Java

I developed a student course information website using HTML, CSS, and Java. This website provides students with comprehensive information about their courses, including course descriptions, schedules, instructors, and assignments. The website also includes a validation feature to ensure that students are entering accurate information.
